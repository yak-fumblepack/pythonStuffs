## Neural network made with numpy from scratch

This is a fully functioning neural network that I made in python using numpy. It was made as an example for my two [blog posts](https://fumbleyak.netlify.app/tag/deep-learning/) on deep learning with numpy and python. 


Clone this repo, fork it, copy paste the code, it's up to you. But if you want to just run this, I suggest copy pasting it into your favourite text editor. Just remember to install all of the dependencies (numpy).
